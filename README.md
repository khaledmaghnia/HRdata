# Analysing and applying ML methods to a salary database
The purpose of this project is to apply data transformations and machine learning techniques in order to predict the expected salary of people person given a few descriptors such as their job title, their education and their experience.

While the dataset examined here is a simplified data model of a real-world job market, the procedures implemented here should be easily transferable to more complex scenarios and with a richer variety of categories.
## The Data

The data we will work on in this project are:

- 1,000,000 training examples, complete with salary information
- 1,000,000 test examples, with no salary information attached

As we will see when looking at the properties of each feature, at a first look the data seem to have been machine-generated over a uniform distribution. We will expect a lot of noise barring us from predicting the target with very high accuracy. Nevertheless, the data do show some interesting pattern that will eventually drive our hypotheses in building an appropriate model.
